        <div class=" col-12 sm-6 col-md-3">One of the pillars of American mythology is the “bootstrap” theory of self-improvement and
            personal progress. In this thinking, the individuals pull themselves up to a better station in life by their
            own bootstraps, i.e., personal initiative and drive. And even though we know that self-levitation is not
            possible, we have let this antigravity metaphor dominate our thinking about where responsibility lies for
            improving your lot and getting ahead in American society.

            In the continuing tension between liberty (an individual notion) and justice (a societal notion), the time
            has come to say that all personal progress is not the sole responsibility of the individual. Other factors
            matter, a lot.</div>
